# Tech Choices

## Front

### Vue.js 2
- my fav js framework and the one i'm most experienced with.

#### Plugins
- Vuetify -- good looking componnents,
- Vue Router,
- Vuex,

I decided i'm not going to use Axios since this project is small and won't utilise it's potential, and modern browsers already support behind the scenes HTTP requests.

## Database

### Firebase
It's going to be a small project so it doesn't require more configurable db.

## Security
Security of this app is non existing. I know that exposing API keys etc. isn't the smartest thing, but I trust you (and for later projects I'll learn more about it and implement it with all caution necessary)
